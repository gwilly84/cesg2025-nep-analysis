## 🔍 Abstract

This project reinterprets the 1980 NEP as a reactive federal intervention rather than the cause of Alberta’s economic divergence. Using a custom provincial panel dataset (1975–1990) constructed from publicly available data from Statistics Canada and FRED, we apply Difference-in-Differences, Event Study, and Synthetic Control methods to evaluate Alberta’s relative performance.

The analysis shows Alberta's economy—measured by real GDP per worker and real wages—was already diverging from central Canada before the NEP. This divergence intensified post-implementation, suggesting that the NEP muted oil-linked gains rather than triggering them.
