## 📄 Overview

This paper examines the economic impact of the 1980 National Energy Program (NEP) using provincial-level data from 1975 to 1990. Framed through Donald Creighton’s *Laurentian thesis*, the analysis evaluates whether the NEP was the cause of Alberta’s divergence or a reaction to regional economic realities already in motion.

Applying modern econometric techniques—including Difference-in-Differences and the Synthetic Control Method—this study contributes to both historical and empirical understandings of Canadian federalism and regional economic policy.
