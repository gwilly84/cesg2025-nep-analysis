# CESG 2025 ‚Äì NEP Analysis: Data Sources

This document outlines all data tables and external sources used to construct the provincial panel dataset for the analysis of the 1980 National Energy Program (NEP). All monetary values were deflated to 1986 dollars using the appropriate provincial CPI series. Alberta and eight comparator provinces are included; Prince Edward Island was excluded due to missing key indicators.

## üîÅ Data Processing Notes

- All monetary variables are deflated to 1986 CAD.
- Where values were missing (e.g., 1975 employment/wages), linear interpolation was applied to balance the panel.
- GDP and wage metrics are aggregated from industry-level to provincial-level indicators using population or employment weighting where applicable.
