# ðŸ§¾ Dominion and Divergence: Creighton, Econometrics, and the National Energy Program

This repository accompanies the CESG 2025 submission:  
**"Dominion and Divergence: Creighton, Econometrics, and the National Energy Program"**  
by **Greg Williams**.

It contains the data documentation code for constructing a custom provincial panel dataset spanning **1975â€“1990**, used to evaluate the impact of the National Energy Program (NEP) on Alberta relative to other Canadian provinces.

---

## ðŸ—‚ Data Sources and Construction

A balanced panel was built from publicly available Canadian data.  
**Prince Edward Island** and **Newfoundland and Labrador** were excluded due to gaps in key macroeconomic series.

All monetary variables are deflated to constant **1986 dollars** using province-specific CPI indices.  
Where 1975 data were unavailableâ€”particularly for employment and wagesâ€”values were **linearly interpolated**.

## ðŸ§® Outcome Variables (Log, Real 1986 CAD)

The following log-transformed and deflated variables are used as outcome variables:

| Variable                   | Formula                                           | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `log(GDP per worker)`     | Real GDP (mining) Ã· total employment              | Capital productivity in the resource sector      |
| `log(Wages per worker)`   | Real wages Ã· total employment                     | Labour market returns                            |
| `log(GDP per capita)`     | Real GDP (mining) Ã· population                    | Proxy for general economic performance           |

## ðŸ“Š Econometric Framework

To identify the effects of the NEP (treatment year: 1981), three causal inference designs are used:

1. **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**  
   Two-way fixed effects model with Alberta Ã— Post interactions and macroeconomic controls.

2. **Event Study**  
   Dynamic DiD extension using event-time indicators from *k = â€“5* to *k = +9*.

3. **Synthetic Control Method (SCM)**  
   Ridge-regularized donor weighting minimizes pre-NEP RMSE to build a synthetic Alberta counterfactual.

All model outputsâ€”including figures and regression tablesâ€”are found in the paper.
